# Project Week 3 and 4 - *Twitter Client*

**Twitter Client** is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **10+** hours spent in total

**IMPORTANT:**
In order to use the application, developer needs to create a secrets.xml file accordingly to the["Secrets in resource files" codepath.com guide](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Storing-Secret-Keys-in-Android#secrets-in-resource-files) and store the following keys:

* **est_api_twitter_consumer_secret** : [Twitter REST API](https://apps.twitter.com/) Consumer Secret
* **est_api_twitter_consumer_secret** : [Twitter REST API](https://apps.twitter.com/) Consumer Key

**secrets.xml** sample:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="rest_api_twitter_consumer_secret"> </string>
    <string name="rest_api_twitter_consumer_key"> </string>
</resources>
```
